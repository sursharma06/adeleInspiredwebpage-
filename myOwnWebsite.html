            <h3>Highlights of Adele 2016!!</h3>
            <p class="textformat">I let it fall, my heart,And as it fell you rose to claim it
              It was dark and <span class="highlight">I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
              My hands, they're strong But my knees were far too weak</span>
              To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet
              But there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew
              All the things you'd say They were never true, never true
              And the games you play <span class="standout">You would always win, always win
              But I set fire to the rain</span> Watched it pour as I touched your face
              Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
              When I lay with you I could stay there Close my eyes
              Feel you here forever You and me together Nothing is better
